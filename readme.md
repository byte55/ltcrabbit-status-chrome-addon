Here where are rabbit's! We wrote a small Chrome-addon, to show your worker's hashrate, so no exessiv F5 needed ;)

It will use the LTCrabbit API.

Click on the new icon in chrome and it will show a popup simliar to this:

The data will be loaded on opening. You can force a refresh via clicking on the Refresh-Button ;)
